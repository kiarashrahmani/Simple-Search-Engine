      "ID: 1, Sentence: What are recurrent neural networks?\n",
      "ID: 2, Sentence: A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data.\n",
      "ID: 3, Sentence: These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning; they are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, voice search, and Google Translate.\n",
      "ID: 4, Sentence: Like feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks utilize training data to learn.\n",
      "ID: 5, Sentence: They are distinguished by their “memory” as they take information from prior inputs to influence the current input and output.\n",
      "ID: 6, Sentence: While traditional deep neural networks assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other, the output of recurrent neural networks depend on the prior elements within the sequence.\n",
      "ID: 7, Sentence: While future events would also be helpful in determining the output of a given sequence, unidirectional recurrent neural networks cannot account for these events in their predictions.\n",
      "ID: 8, Sentence: Let’s take an idiom, such as “feeling under the weather”, which is commonly used when someone is ill, to aid us in the explanation of RNNs.\n",
      "ID: 9, Sentence: In order for the idiom to make sense, it needs to be expressed in that specific order.\n",
      "ID: 10, Sentence: As a result, recurrent networks need to account for the position of each word in the idiom and they use that information to predict the next word in the sequence.\n",
      "ID: 11, Sentence: Another distinguishing characteristic of recurrent networks is that they share parameters across each layer of the network.\n",
      "ID: 12, Sentence: While feedforward networks have different weights across each node, recurrent neural networks share the same weight parameter within each layer of the network.\n",
      "ID: 13, Sentence: That said, these weights are still adjusted in the through the processes of backpropagation and gradient descent to facilitate reinforcement learning.\n",
      "ID: 14, Sentence: Recurrent neural networks leverage backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm to determine the gradients, which is slightly different from traditional backpropagation as it is specific to sequence data.\n",
      "ID: 15, Sentence: The principles of BPTT are the same as traditional backpropagation, where the model trains itself by calculating errors from its output layer to its input layer.\n",
      "ID: 16, Sentence: These calculations allow us to adjust and fit the parameters of the model appropriately.\n",
      "ID: 17, Sentence: BPTT differs from the traditional approach in that BPTT sums errors at each time step whereas feedforward networks do not need to sum errors as they do not share parameters across each layer.\n",
      "ID: 18, Sentence: Through this process, RNNs tend to run into two problems, known as exploding gradients and vanishing gradients.\n",
      "ID: 19, Sentence: These issues are defined by the size of the gradient, which is the slope of the loss function along the error curve.\n",
      "ID: 20, Sentence: When the gradient is too small, it continues to become smaller, updating the weight parameters until they become insignificant—i.e.\n",
      "ID: 21, Sentence: 0.\n",
      "ID: 22, Sentence: When that occurs, the algorithm is no longer learning.\n",
      "ID: 23, Sentence: Exploding gradients occur when the gradient is too large, creating an unstable model.\n",
      "ID: 24, Sentence: In this case, the model weights will grow too large, and they will eventually be represented as NaN.\n",
      "ID: 25, Sentence: One solution to these issues is to reduce the number of hidden layers within the neural network, eliminating some of the complexity in the RNN model.\n",
      "ID: 26, Sentence: Types of recurrent neural networks: Feedforward networks map one input to one output, and while we’ve visualized recurrent neural networks in this way in the above diagrams, they do not actually have this constraint.\n",
      "ID: 27, Sentence: Instead, their inputs and outputs can vary in length, and different types of RNNs are used for different use cases, such as music generation, sentiment classification, and machine translation.A Brief Overview of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): This article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n",
      "ID: 28, Sentence: Apple’s Siri and Google’s voice search both use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are the state-of-the-art method for sequential data.\n",
      "ID: 29, Sentence: It’s the first algorithm with an internal memory that remembers its input, making it perfect for problems involving sequential data in machine learning.\n",
      "ID: 30, Sentence: It’s one of the algorithms responsible for the incredible advances in deep learning over the last few years.\n",
      "ID: 31, Sentence: In this article, we’ll go over the fundamentals of recurrent neural networks, as well as the most pressing difficulties and how to address them.\n",

      "Source: Medium.com\n",
      "Recurrent Neural Networks use the same weights for each element of the sequence, decreasing the number of parameters and allowing the model to generalize to sequences of varying lengths.\n",
      "ID: 37, Sentence: RNNs generalize to structured data other than sequential data, such as geographical or graphical data, because of its design.\n",
      "ID: 38, Sentence: Recurrent neural networks, like many other deep learning techniques, are relatively old.\n",
      "ID: 39, Sentence: They were first developed in the 1980s, but we didn’t appreciate their full potential until lately.\n",
      "ID: 40, Sentence: The advent of long short-term memory (LSTM) in the 1990s, combined with an increase in computational power and the vast amounts of data that we now have to deal with, has really pushed RNNs to the forefront.\n",

      "ID: 71, Sentence: It is extremely beneficial to data scientists who are tasked with collecting, analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data; deep learning makes this process faster and easier.\n",
      "ID: 72, Sentence: Where human brains have millions of interconnected neurons that work together to learn information, deep learning features neural networks constructed from multiple layers of software nodes that work together.\n",

      "ID: 75, Sentence: To understand deep learning, imagine a toddler whose first word is dog.\n",
      "ID: 76, Sentence: The toddler learns what a dog is -- and is not -- by pointing to objects and saying the word dog.\n",
      "ID: 77, Sentence: The parent says, \"Yes, that is a dog,\" or, \"No, that is not a dog.\"\n",
      "ID: 78, Sentence: As the toddler continues to point to objects, he becomes more aware of the features that all dogs possess.\n",

      "ID: 93, Sentence: The advantage of deep learning is the program builds the feature set by itself without supervision.\n",
      "ID: 94, Sentence: Initially, the computer program might be provided with training data -- a set of images for which a human has labeled each image dog or not dog with metatags.\n",
      "ID: 95, Sentence: The program uses the information it receives from the training data to create a feature set for dog and build a predictive model.\n",
      "ID: 96, Sentence: In this case, the model the computer first creates might predict that anything in an image that has four legs and a tail should be labeled dog.\n",
      "ID: 97, Sentence: Of course, the program is not aware of the labels four legs or tail.\n",
